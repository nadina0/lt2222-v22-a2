I implemented the random selection with random.choices after reading the documentation for random and finding it one of the easier 
choices available.

For Part 6, the scores were:

For linear:
The precision score is:0.5633802816901409
The recall score is: 0.022573363431151242
The f1 score is: 0.04340748779164406

For rbf:
The precision score is:0.6792452830188679
The recall score is: 0.020316027088036117
The f1 score is: 0.03945205479452054

To be honest I don't really know how to interpret them.
